activerecord-vertica-adapter
============================

It's an ActiveRecord adapter... for Vertica.

Requires some kind of Ruby Vertica connector to be installed. Works with https://github.com/sprsquish/vertica (fork of https://github.com/besquared/vertica), but may work with other Ruby Vertica connectors as well.
